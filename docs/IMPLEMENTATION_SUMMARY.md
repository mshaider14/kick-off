### Build & Linting
- âœ… Build completed successfully
- âœ… All new files pass linting
- âœ… No PropTypes warnings
- âœ… No console errors

## How to Test Manually

### 1. Navigate to Bars Page
- Go to `/app/bars` in the Shopify admin
- You should see either an empty state with "Create Bar" button or a list of existing bars

### 2. Create a New Bar
- Click "Create Bar" button
- You'll be taken to `/app/bars/new`

### 3. Step 1: Bar Type Selection
- Announcement bar is selected by default (and only available option)
- Countdown and shipping bars show as "Coming Soon"
- Click "Next" to continue

### 4. Step 2: Content Configuration
- Enter a message (e.g., "Summer Sale - 20% Off All Items!")
- Optionally add CTA button text (e.g., "Shop Now")
- If you added CTA text, enter a link URL (e.g., "/collections/sale")
- Watch the preview update on the right side
- Click "Next" to continue

### 5. Step 3: Design Customization
- Use color pickers to select background and text colors
- Try different colors and see the preview update
- Select a font size from the dropdown
- Choose position (top or bottom)
- Click "Next" to continue

### 6. Step 4: Targeting & Schedule
- Optionally set start and end dates
- Leave empty for immediate activation with no expiration
- Click "Save as Draft" or "Publish Bar"

### 7. Verify Creation
- You should see a success toast message
- You'll be redirected back to `/app/bars`
- The new bar should appear in the list with correct status

### 8. Test Preview Updates
- Go back through the steps
- Change any field and verify the preview updates immediately
- Test color changes, text changes, position changes

### 9. Test Validation
- Try to proceed without entering a message (should show error)
- Try to add CTA text without a link (should show error)
- Try invalid dates (end before start) (should show error)

### 10. Test Navigation
- Navigate back and forth between steps
- Verify all your entered data is preserved
- Change something in step 2, go to step 4, then back to step 2 (data should be there)

## Known Limitations

1. **Bar Types**: Currently only announcement bars are fully implemented. Countdown and shipping bars are marked as "Coming Soon".

2. **Advanced Targeting**: The targeting step currently only supports date-based scheduling. Advanced options like page-specific targeting or customer segments are noted for future implementation.

3. **Bar Editing**: The current implementation focuses on creation. Editing existing bars would be a natural next step.

4. **Bar Deletion**: Not implemented in this phase.

5. **Migration**: The Prisma schema has been updated but a migration file needs to be generated when deploying to production with `npx prisma migrate deploy`.

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Edit Functionality**: Add ability to edit existing bars
2. **Delete Functionality**: Add ability to delete bars with confirmation
3. **Duplicate Bars**: Quick duplication of existing bars
4. **Countdown Timer Type**: Implement countdown timer bars
5. **Shipping Progress Type**: Implement free shipping progress bars
6. **Advanced Targeting**: 
   - Specific page targeting
   - Customer segment targeting
   - Device targeting (mobile/desktop)
7. **Analytics**: Track impressions and click-through rates
8. **A/B Testing**: Compare performance of different bars
9. **Templates**: Pre-configured bar templates for common use cases
10. **Preview in Context**: Show preview in actual storefront theme
