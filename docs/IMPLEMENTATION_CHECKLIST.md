## üîÑ Manual Testing Required

### Device Targeting Tests
- [ ] Open bar on desktop browser - verify it shows when targeting "desktop" or "both"
- [ ] Open bar on mobile browser - verify it shows when targeting "mobile" or "both"
- [ ] Set targeting to "desktop only" - verify it hides on mobile
- [ ] Set targeting to "mobile only" - verify it hides on desktop

### Page Targeting Tests
- [ ] Set to "All pages" - verify shows on every page
- [ ] Set to "Homepage only" - verify shows only on `/`
- [ ] Set to "Product pages" - verify shows on product detail pages
- [ ] Set to "Collection pages" - verify shows on collection listing pages
- [ ] Set to "Cart page" - verify shows on cart page
- [ ] Set to "Specific URLs" - add URLs and verify exact matching
  - Add `/collections/sale`
  - Verify shows on sale collection
  - Verify doesn't show on other collections
- [ ] Set to "URL pattern" - test each pattern type
  - "Contains" - enter "sale", verify matches `/collections/sale`, `/products/sale-item`
  - "Starts with" - enter `/collections`, verify matches all collection pages
  - "Ends with" - enter `.html`, verify matches pages ending with .html

### Display Frequency Tests
- [ ] Set to "Always" - verify bar shows on every page refresh
- [ ] Set to "Once per session"
  - Verify bar shows on first visit
  - Close bar
  - Navigate to another page
  - Verify bar doesn't show again in same session
  - Close browser and reopen
  - Verify bar shows again in new session
- [ ] Set to "Once per visitor"
  - Verify bar shows on first visit
  - Close bar
  - Navigate to another page
  - Verify bar doesn't show
  - Close browser and reopen
  - Verify bar still doesn't show (cookie persists)
  - Clear cookies
  - Verify bar shows again

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Create announcement bar with targeting rules - verify saves correctly
- [ ] Create countdown bar with targeting rules - verify saves correctly
- [ ] Create shipping bar with targeting rules - verify saves correctly
- [ ] Edit existing bar - verify targeting rules load correctly
- [ ] Activate bar - verify targeting rules apply on storefront
- [ ] Deactivate bar - verify targeting rules no longer apply

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Enter empty specific URLs list - verify validation error
- [ ] Enter empty pattern value - verify validation error
- [ ] Test with very long URL list (10+ URLs)
- [ ] Test pattern matching with special characters
- [ ] Test frequency with multiple bars
- [ ] Test schedule + targeting combination

## üì∏ UI Screenshots Needed

To complete the PR, take screenshots of:
- [ ] Targeting Rules UI - Device targeting dropdown
- [ ] Targeting Rules UI - Page targeting options
- [ ] Targeting Rules UI - Specific URLs with tags
- [ ] Targeting Rules UI - URL pattern matcher with examples
- [ ] Targeting Rules UI - Display frequency selector
- [ ] Complete step 4 view showing both Targeting Rules and Schedule
- [ ] Example bar with targeting rules active on storefront
- [ ] Browser console showing targeting validation logs

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Targeting Rules as Separate Component**: Kept targeting rules separate from scheduling to maintain clear separation of concerns
2. **JSON Storage**: Used JSON strings for complex data (URL lists, patterns) to avoid additional database tables
3. **Client-side Validation**: Implemented targeting validation in storefront JavaScript for performance
4. **Cookie Duration**: Set visitor cookies to 365 days as a reasonable "forever" duration
5. **Pattern Types**: Implemented three pattern types (contains, starts with, ends with) as they cover most common use cases

### Known Limitations
1. Pattern matching is case-sensitive
2. Specific URLs use prefix matching (may match subpaths unintentionally)
3. Mobile detection relies on user agent (can be spoofed)
4. Once per visitor requires cookies to be enabled
5. No geographic or customer segment targeting (future enhancement)

### Breaking Changes
None. All changes are additive and backward compatible.

### Migration Notes
- Existing bars will have default targeting rules (both devices, all pages, always show)
- No data migration needed beyond adding new columns with defaults
- Bar behavior unchanged unless targeting rules are explicitly configured

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Complete manual testing checklist
2. Take UI screenshots
3. Create PR with screenshots
4. Address any bugs found during testing
5. Deploy to staging environment
6. User acceptance testing
7. Deploy to production

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

Based on the issue description, these features could be added later:
- Customer segment targeting (logged in vs guest)
- Geographic targeting (by country/region)
- Time-based targeting (day of week, time of day)
- Cart value targeting
- Traffic source targeting
- A/B testing capabilities
- Advanced analytics for targeting effectiveness
